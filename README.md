# GUI-Password-Manager

Can safely store:
  1. Passwords, Usernames
  2. Credit/Debit cards

Encryption:
  * Sha256 for the Master password
  * AES (if I understood it correctly) for passwords and credit/debit cards

Features:
  * Multiple Accounts

It does not have all the same features as the Python version yet <br>
But I am working on them

<br>
Currently, only passwords and cards screen works

Notes and Settings are not implemented yet
