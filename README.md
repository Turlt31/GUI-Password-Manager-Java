# GUI-Password-Manager

Can safely store:
  1. Passwords, Usernames
  2. Credit/Debit cards
  3. Notes

Encryption:
  * Sha256 for the Master password
  * AES (if I understood it correctly) for passwords, credit/debit cards and notes

Features:
  * Multiple Accounts
  * Two factor-authentication is back
  * Scrollbar is back (Fits up to 100 accounts or cards on the screen)
  * Notes (This time with encryption)
